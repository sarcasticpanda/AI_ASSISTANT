🎵 SPOTIFY API SETUP - 100% RELIABLE AUTO-PLAY
=================================================

This makes Spotify work EXACTLY like Alexa/Google Home!
✅ Instant playback - no window focusing
✅ No typing in wrong windows
✅ Professional, reliable solution

SETUP STEPS (5 minutes):
========================

STEP 1: Create Spotify Developer App
-------------------------------------
1. Go to: https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard
2. Click "Log In" (use your Spotify account)
3. Click "Create app"
4. Fill in:
   - App name: Jarvis Assistant
   - App description: Voice assistant music control
   - Redirect URIs: http://localhost:8888/callback
   - Which API/SDKs: Web API
   - Check "I understand"
5. Click "Save"

STEP 2: Get Your Credentials
-----------------------------
1. Click on your new "Jarvis Assistant" app
2. Click "Settings" (top right)
3. You'll see:
   - Client ID: abc123... (COPY THIS)
   - Client secret: Click "View client secret" (COPY THIS)

STEP 3: Add to .env File
-------------------------
1. Open: c:\Users\Lunar Panda\3-Main\assistant\.env
2. Add these lines at the bottom:

SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=paste_your_client_id_here
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=paste_your_client_secret_here
SPOTIFY_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:8888/callback

3. Save the file

STEP 4: Test It!
-----------------
1. Make sure Spotify desktop app is OPEN and logged in
2. Run: python tests\test_spotify_api.py
3. First time: Browser will open asking to authorize
4. Click "Agree" 
5. You'll be redirected to localhost (page will fail - THAT'S OK!)
6. Copy the ENTIRE URL from browser address bar
7. Paste it in the terminal
8. Done! Authorization saved forever

STEP 5: Try Voice Command
--------------------------
python tests\phase1_online.py

Say: "play shape of you on spotify"
→ Song starts playing INSTANTLY! 🎉

TROUBLESHOOTING:
================

"No active Spotify devices found"
→ Open Spotify desktop app first

"Invalid client"
→ Check your Client ID and Secret in .env

"Redirect URI mismatch"  
→ Make sure redirect URI in dashboard is: http://localhost:8888/callback

ALTERNATIVE (If you don't want API setup):
===========================================
Just use YouTube instead:
"play shape of you on youtube"  
→ Works perfectly, auto-plays instantly!

Or change default to YouTube in brain.py
